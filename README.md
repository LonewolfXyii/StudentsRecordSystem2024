# Enhanced Student Grading System GK 2024
This is a Student Record System with Graphical User Interface Done in 2024 with a starting project name "GK-ESGS v1.1"

Welcome to the Enhanced Student Grading System! This project is designed to help educators manage student information, record grades, and provide insights into student performance using a graphical user interface built with `customtkinter`.

## Objective
The objective of this program is to showcase our learnings from python programing done in GK COLLEGE for the course Introduction To Programming by Sir Raleigh Guevarra.

## Features and Limitations

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Secure registration and login system.
- **Student Information Management**: Add, update, and delete student records.
- **Grade Recording and Analysis**: Input and analyze grades for assignments, quizzes, and exams.
- **Graphical Visualizations**: Display student performance through various graphs and charts.
- **Dark/Light Mode Switch**: Toggle between light and dark modes for better accessibility.
- **Themes Selection**: Choose a visually appealing themes right out of the program.

Limitations:
There are many limitations and future improvement and bugs in this program 
since it is still "UNDER DEVELOPMENT".
But for the students to learn how to code something like this, they can
try to figure out how the program works!  
Best of luck!!!
